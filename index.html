            We are a dedicated group of high school students committed to providing every student with high-quality STEM education through hands-on, interactive learning experiences. In this program, we will utilize Snap Circuits to teach children the fundamentals of circuit design, enabling them to create engaging and educational projects. Upon completion of the program, we will donate these kits to the library, ensuring that curious students have the opportunity to continue exploring and learning during their free time.
